What is SSC?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SSC is an open-source and free software for solar physics. The project provides a real-time and fully automated comprehensive data analysis environment that allows researchers within the field of solar physics to carry out their tasks with the minimal effort. At this stage of development, the project generates sunspot data based on SDO observations. Later, the database will be extended by other solar features, such as pores, faculea or coronal hole. 

SSC is written using the Python programming language and is build upon the scientific Python environment which includes several core packages such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Bokeh and Sunpy. The project SSC fully acknowledges these softwares and kindly ask You to cite them appropriately.

What is it good for?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The software is designed to assist solar feature data analysis, for instance, 

- active region recognision tool with sunspot conturs

- create html webpages without knowing html 

- to document source code
