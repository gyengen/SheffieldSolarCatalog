What is SSC?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

SSC is an open-source and free software for solar physics. The project provides a real-time comprehensive data analysis environment that allows researchers within the field of solar physics to carry out their tasks with the minimal effort. At this stage of development, the project generates sunspot data based on SDO observations. The program is fully automated and real-time. Later, the database will be extended by other solar features, such as pores, faculea or coronal hole. Follow the link Get Started to open the database or click on the Documentation to read the detailed descrition of the applied methodology.

SSC is written using the Python programming language and is build upon the scientific Python environment which includes several core packages such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Pandas, Bokeh and Sunpy. The project SSC fully acknowledges these softwares and kindly ask You to cite them appropriately.

reStructuredText can be used, for example, to

- write technical documentation (so that it can easily be offered as a
  pdf file or a web page)

- create html webpages without knowing html 

- to document source code
